            <p class="mb-4">Special categories of personal data, also referred to as "sensitive data," such as health information, may only be gathered and processed to the extent required to fulfil our legal and contractual duties, such as giving you a safe place to work or abiding by social security laws.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Unless processing of your sensitive personal data is required for other legally permitted purposes (e.g., to comply with our obligations in the employment or social security field, or to establish or defend a legal claim), we will only process sensitive data with your express consent.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Please do not disclose any sensitive personal data about yourself to us unless we request it or it is essential to do so. Unsolicited personal data will be deleted and we should not be hold responsible for any such unsolicited data.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Additionally, for whatever purpose, we may gather, utilise, and distribute aggregated data, such as demographic or statistical data. Although aggregated data may come from your personal data, it is not legally regarded as personal data since it does not directly or indirectly reveal who you are. We might combine your Usage Data, for instance, to determine the proportion of visitors to a certain website feature. However, we treat combined data as personal data that will be used in compliance with this privacy notice if we connect or combine Aggregated Data with your personal data in a way that makes it possible for it to identify you either directly or indirectly.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">We will send you a supplemental Privacy Notice outlining our processing of any additional categories of personal data (including sensitive personal data) about you that are not on the above list when we collect or process them.</p>

            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-700 mb-2">Criminal records data</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">We may collect and process data related to criminal allegations, proceedings, convictions, offences or related security measures only under the control of an official authority or when authorised by EU or EU Member State law.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">If you fail to provide personal data, we might not be able to help you with job searching, hiring, or other relevant services if you do not give us your personal information when asked.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-700 mb-4">3. HOW IS YOUR PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED?</h3>

            <p class="mb-4">When you visit our website, register with us, or connect with us via phone, email, SMS, mobile app, social media, direct messaging, or in person, we may gather data about you. For security, regulatory compliance, or training purposes, we might record audio or video conversations.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">We obtain information about you from various sources using a variety of techniques, such as employment boards, social media sites like LinkedIn, analytics companies, advertising networks, pay roll providers, referencing companies, publicly accessible sources like Companies House and the Electoral Register, referees, tax authorities, or other governmental organisations.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">These organisations may be based inside or outside the EU.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-700 mb-4">4. HOW AND WHY WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA?</h3>

            <p class="mb-4">We will only use your personal data when we are permitted to do so by law. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:</p>
            <ul class="mb-4">
                <li>Where we need to perform our obligations under the contract which we are about to enter into, or have entered into, with you.</li>
                <li>Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li>
                <li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.</li>
                <li>Where you consent to our doing so.</li>
                <li>Where (rarely) we need to protect vital interests.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4">We may occasionally need to process specific types of personal data in order to fulfil our legal requirements under applicable tax, social security, or other laws. You are not required to give us your personal information, but if you don't, we might not be able to fulfil our legal requirements and might not be able to help you obtain employment or other related services.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">In order to engage into a contract with you and fulfil our end of the bargain, we also need to process specific categories of your personal data.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">In order to further our legitimate business interests, we may nonetheless need to treat your personal data even in the absence of any contractual or legal obligations. As part of our business, we offer recruitment, work-finding, and related services; therefore, in order to pursue our legitimate interests in doing so, we may need to process your personal data. In the event that we must prove or refute a legal claim, we might also need to keep hold of personal data. We shall weigh your rights and freedoms, as well as your legitimate interests and expectations, against ours.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">In some situations, such as when processing your data for the purpose of sending you direct marketing via email or SMS (text message), using cookies when you visit our website, or handling sensitive personal data, we may rely on your consent.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">We might also need to analyse your data in extremely rare cases to preserve human life.</p>

            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-700 mb-2">Marketing</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">In order to stay in touch with you regarding news and material that we believe you would find interesting, we would like to use your contact information. However, unless you give us permission to do so, we won't contact you with marketing materials.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">If you have previously asked us for information or services and you did not choose to opt out of receiving marketing communications from us at that time, you might also receive marketing messages from us.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">You can always opt out of receiving marketing emails by clicking the unsubscribe link found in the footer of each one.</p>

            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-700 mb-2">Job alerts</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">If you have requested it, we may use your personal information to contact you about appropriate career opportunities. By selecting the link that appears in marketing emails' footers, you can opt out of automated job notifications at any time.</p>

            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-700 mb-2">Third party marketing</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">We will only provide your explicit opt-in consent before sharing your personal information with outside parties for marketing purposes.</p>

            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-700 mb-2">Change of purpose</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">Until we reasonably determine that we need to use your personal data for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose, we will only use it for the reasons for which it was obtained.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">We will let you know if we need to use your personal information for an unconnected reason and will explain the legal justification for doing so.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Please be aware that in accordance with the aforementioned guidelines, we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent if necessary or allowed by law.</p>

It will also be given to the proper third parties, like potential hirers and intermediaries. If you would prefer that your personal information not be shared with any specific third party or group of related third parties, then let us know.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">A third-party organisation might be used by us to verify credentials, employment history, and references. Certain categories of your personal data will need to be sent to them by us, and they will be required to process it in compliance with applicable data protection laws and our instructions. If necessary, we might also need to give your pension provider access to specific categories of your personal data.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Additionally, we might need to give our professional advisors—such as attorneys and accountants—access to your information.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">In the event that we decide to sell, transfer, or combine portions of our company or our assets, we might also disclose your personal information to outside parties. As an alternative, we might look to buy or combine with other companies. In the event that our company is acquired, the new owners may use your personal information in the manner described in this privacy notice.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Your personal information won't be disclosed to any other company unless it's required in order for us to provide our employment, search, and associated services.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">We demand that all third parties protect the confidentiality of your personal information and handle it legally. We only give our third-party service providers permission to treat your personal data for the purposes that we specify and in line with our instructions; we do not allow them to use it for their own purposes.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-700 mb-4">6. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</h3>

            <p class="mb-4">Your personal information will be processed and kept on servers located locally or in the cloud, both inside and outside the European Economic Area (EEA). It will also be protected by organisational and technical safeguards. The members of the European Union (EU) as well as Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein make up the EEA.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">It is possible to transfer some types of data to organisations outside the EEA. In order to help us provide work-finding, recruitment, and related services, if it becomes necessary to transfer your data from an EEA nation to a non-EEA nation, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data is protected to the same extent as that offered by the EU and that it is subject to organisational and technical safeguarding protection measures, as follows:</p>
            <ul class="mb-4">
                <li>We will only send your personal information to businesses outside the European Economic Area (EEA) if the business:</li>
                <li>is based in a country which has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission, or</li>
                <li>has entered into an agreement with us which contains specific contract clauses approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection that it has in Europe; or</li>
                <li>where you have provided your express consent to such a transfer.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4">For further details, please see the following:</p>
            <ul class="mb-4">

            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4">Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-700 mb-4">7. DATA SECURITY</h3>

            <p class="mb-4">We have implemented the necessary security measures to guard against the unintentional loss, alteration, disclosure, or unauthorised use or access to your personal information. Additionally, we only grant those workers, representatives, contractors, and other third parties that have a "need to know" basis access to your personal information. They are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information, and they will only process it on our orders.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">We will only give personal information to a third party if they guarantee to abide by those policies and procedures and take the necessary precautions before receiving it to protect the privacy, availability, and integrity of the information (for permitted uses only).</p>
            <p class="mb-4">We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are required by law to do so.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-700 mb-4">8. DATA RETENTION</h3>

            <p class="mb-4">Your personal information will only be kept by us for as long as is required to accomplish the goals for which it was obtained, including meeting any legal, accounting, or reporting obligations.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">We are required by law to retain specific applicant data for a period of one to seven years. In cases where we have a contract with you, we might additionally need to keep your data for up to seven years so that we can fulfil our end of the bargain.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">We generally don't keep your data longer than seven years after the last placement date.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Otherwise, we will not keep your data for more than 2 years from the date of registration or the date when we last had meaningful contact with you (whichever is later).</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-700 mb-4">9. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h3>

            <p class="mb-4">Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. These include the right to:</p>
